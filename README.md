## Develop in Local Machine

### Prerequisites

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repo in your local machine

    `git clone https://github.com/sanspace/roopac-shopify-theme.git`

TODO: Add instructions for fork and clone.

2. Add the `config.yml`. Get this from a roopac admin and place it in the root directory (where this [README](README.md) is).

3. Now, we're creating a live environment. **Be careful** with this. Whatever change you make in local will show up in the live site.

    `theme watch`

4. If you wanna revert to the base run the below.

    `git checkout .`

5. If you are good with your changes and wanna save them, please make a new commit and make a PR.
